# Sample Event Scripts for Templater 2
Events make it easy for you to write shell scripts that can be "hooked" into Templater's processes.  These are some sample scripts that can be executed while Templater runs a batch process.  Pro or Bot features must be available to Templater 2 in order to make use of event scripts.
